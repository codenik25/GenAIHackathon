# 🎥 TrendTales  
*Giving artisans a digital voice through AI-powered storytelling & trend insights*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Indian artisans hold centuries of cultural heritage, but many lack access to modern digital marketing tools. **TrendTales** helps bridge this gap by transforming an artisan’s **voice note + photo** into a **ready-to-post Instagram reel**, complete with captions, hashtags, and trend recommendations.

Built during a hackathon, this MVP combines **AI-generated content** and **real-time trend analysis** to make digital storytelling **simple, accessible, and impactful**.

- 🖼️ **Photo-to-Reel Generation** – Artisan image + narration combined into a vertical reel with subtitles.  
- 🤖 **AI-powered Narration & Captions** – Vertex AI generates reel script, catchy captions, and hashtags.  
- 🎶 **Audio Enhancement** – Denoised voice + background music mixing for professional feel.  
- 📊 **Trend Insights** – Google Trends + social signals to suggest hashtags, styles, and best posting times.
